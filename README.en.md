A cloud Agent product for Hong Kong enterprises. This repository owns **Admin Dashboard** and publishes to `admin`.

<!-- client01-direction -->
## Current client direction and qualified scope

CLIENT01 (2026-10-22) requires **Desktop to run Codex on the customer's computer**, with a real user-opt-in **full local access** mode and Codex Desktop as the operation benchmark. The **Extension uses a ChatGPT-style conversation and attachment layout in Chrome's native right Side Panel**, reads user-selected files and uploads them for cloud Codex execution. All product AI calls still use the company gateway.

**Current implementation:** Desktop runs Codex on the customer device with explicit full access, local files/terminal, persistent threads, native questions, company design/video tools and native workflow children. Twelve local browser tools now perform actual navigation, interaction, upload, screenshots and downloads; Stop/revoke reclaim owned pages. Desktop hides scrollbar rails and reflows artifacts, code and tables while preserving vertical scrolling and keyboard access. The previous progress-bar constraint is withdrawn; truthful progress feedback remains. Separate qualification covers 851 platform, 68 client, 17 native-supervisor, 10 standalone Electron-browser and 25 packaged-journey checks; counts are not additive. Full professional delivery across 18 roles/29 Skills, complete OS-application/Codex Desktop parity, live models and production remain pending. Extension retains independent ChatGPT-style native right Side Panel cloud chat and authorized-file upload; its UI was not rerun. See [design](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/technical/77-desktop-native-browser.md), [layout requirements](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/requirements/04-desktop-layout-and-scroll.md) and [source/media checkpoint](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/quality/desktop-browser-checkpoint.json).

Desktop runs the native Agent locally; the Web and Extension run cloud Codex. The linked stage 73 proof states the tested scope.

Native supervisor scope, actual permission checks and remaining integration: [implementation details](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/technical/70-desktop-native-codex-supervisor.md).

## Architecture and constraints

Codex is the only Agent kernel. All AI calls use the company's internal OpenAI-compatible server. Web, Desktop, extension and Admin share server identity, permissions, sources and billing controls. UI follows CopyPaste brand assets, colors, typography and bilingual patterns.

```

## Administration and operator flow

1. Enroll through trusted CLI or an administrator invitation. Sign in with a separate administrator email code and TOTP. Customer sessions cannot enter Admin directly.
2. Filter users, workspaces, projects, account state, VIP and charge periods within current scope. Usage is attributed to its actual initiator; holds and reconciliation remain separate.
3. User details expose workspace membership, plans, access, funding context and authorized management actions for accounts, sessions, membership, VIP and fees.
4. Sensitive writes first preview target, version, payload and impact, then commit idempotently. Policy thresholds require independent review. MFA freshness and anti-self-grant rules continue to apply.
5. Content metadata, private body access, downloads, quarantine/restore, share revocation and erasure have distinct permissions and audit. Ordinary workspace administration does not automatically grant another person's private conversation body.

## Permissions and control plane

Eight built-in administrative roles and sixty-eight normative permission keys support global/workspace/project scope, explicit denies, amount/duration/batch limits and bounded delegation. Finance, VIP, membership, identities, content, plans, model/rate configuration, provider requests, approvals, exports and audit use separate domain controls.

VIP and wallet credit are separate. Fees support manually confirmed postings, gifts, source-bound refunds and reconciliation; online payment acquiring is not integrated. Frozen policy/plan versions, target-version checks and idempotency prevent duplicate actions.

## Source structure

`src/main.tsx` implements navigation and user details. `src/directory.tsx` implements directory/period filters. Domain components implement approvals, fees, entitlements, content and configuration. Backend API authorization and ledger entries are authoritative; hidden UI buttons are not security boundaries.

## Run

```powershell
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4318` after starting backend and enrolling an administrator. `npm run build` produces static deployment files. Production needs a dedicated Admin origin, HTTPS, email, MFA, assigned permissions, recovery administrators and audit retention.

## Demonstration scope

The actual recording establishes a separate session through Backend email OTP and TOTP, then shows directory filtering, customer usage and VIP/credit forms. Opening forms is not represented as a financial posting. Retained database/API and Admin evidence covers write, approval, concurrency and authorization behavior.

## Checkout and prerequisites

Clone this branch into a fresh working directory; update an existing repository without reinitializing it.

```powershell
git clone --single-branch --branch admin git@github.com:copypasteltd/workmate.git copypaste-admin
cd copypaste-admin
```

Use Node.js ≥22.14, npm and Git with pinned lockfiles. The qualified local environment is Windows x64. Backend/full delivery also needs native PostgreSQL launcher resources, cloud-pinned Codex `0.163.0-alpha.10.2` and FFmpeg/FFprobe; Desktop independently pins `0.163.0-alpha.11` in its runtime manifest. No local Docker, WSL or virtualization. Run components in separate directories; see [workspace](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/governance/04-git-branches-and-publication.md).

## Checks and evidence scope

```powershell
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Historical-source **802/802** full Platform tests and **52/52** focused task tests pass, with **13 checks** across six repositories and **32** actual packaged Desktop/native Side Panel checks. All prior 782 named regression cases remain. Task checks exercise actual PostgreSQL, identity, ledger and Worker; separate real Codex child processes use a synthetic internal gateway. UI turns/business data are synthetic as authorized. The original 102 requirements remain: 81 partially verified, 21 without proven completion and zero fully accepted.

Canonical TaskDTO/task creation, arbitrary in-flight pause, unknown-effect recovery, independent complete role workflows, GEO, live suppliers and production/signing/store qualification remain tracked.

This revision adds canonical task APIs and atomic original-task inputs. Current UIs continue to use their existing project/conversation interfaces over the same execution domain. The refreshed actual recordings verify compatibility; they do not claim migration of every UI to canonical task APIs. See [the implementation and limits](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/technical/68-canonical-task-contracts-and-input-transactions.md) for exact money, idempotency, source revocation and unsupported business parameters.

## Actual screens and interactions

Actual recordings preserve capture timing. AI turns/business data are explicitly synthetic. Admin form demonstrations do not claim a financial commit.

## Native browser and scrollbar-free Desktop

Start a new local session, select a folder and explicitly grant Full local access. Ask the local Codex to work in a browser. The trusted frameless address bar and remote page run in separate customer-device renderers. The tool namespace `copypaste_browser` v1 includes tabs/open/navigate/history/snapshot/screenshot/interact/evaluate/wait/dialog/downloads/close; interact supports real click, fill/type/select, keys, scroll/drag and exact local-file upload. Completed downloads remain in the selected workspace’s browser-downloads directory. Model screenshots capture the actual page; README browser media uses actual OS window capture, with no compositing.

Current local permission, company identity, project access, origin and budget are rechecked. Web content cannot grant OS access or acquire company inference credentials. Call IDs bind exact operations; unknown accepted actions never replay automatically. Stop, revoke, sign-out or exit close owned pages and pending downloads, preserving completed files and the customer’s original windows. Existing threads retain their original tool binding; create a new session for browser tools.

The previous progress-bar constraint is withdrawn. Truthful upload/task/workflow/video feedback remains. Hidden scrollbar rails do not disable native scrolling. Artifacts wrap into rows, code and tables reflow, scroll areas have keyboard focus, and the composer/receipt remain usable in actual 800×600, 1280×800 and 1440×980 windows. Real wheel/Home/End and last-download focus are verified, alongside compact billing/devices/account pages and English/Traditional Chinese light/dark controls. Physical touchpad hardware and every display-scaling configuration are not claimed by these automated checks.

Current complete inventory: 66 test files / 17 batches / 851 passing cases, retaining all 848 prior cases. SQL001–094 and all 428 HTTP routes remain unchanged. The isolated UI fixture alone allocates 32 user/platform/tenant slots and appends immutable provider-policy version 2 with 32 slots and 10,000 requests/minute, retaining intentional unknown cancellation holds. Bootstrap policy and production defaults/enforcement remain unchanged. Synthetic Responses, campaign content and native-dialog choices are explicit. Original 102 REQ/102 TC, NFR and G01–G10 remain at 81 partial / 21 unproven / 0 fully accepted. Extension product/verifier bytes are unchanged; no new Extension UI claim.

## Native workflows and verification

Choose Workflow consultant, select a folder and explicitly grant the desired local permission. Describe the work and agree its frozen steps. Review the separate per-child budgets and approve the exact version before a child can reserve money or run. Approve any concrete human step before the next specialist starts. Review real files, private SOP/workflow JSON/recovery downloads and company usage; this conversation and incomplete steps have separate charges. Stop or revoke to terminate local parent and child processes; unknown accepted actions retain reconciliation state and never replay automatically.

The first workflow subset permits up to eight sequential native Codex, human approval or analytics-summary steps. Every child uses its own approved role Skills, company tools and scoped credentials while retaining the current explicit local grant. Local full access does not grant another customer's data, project rights or unlimited budget. Company cloud Workers and schedules cannot take over native workflows. Each immutable version freezes actual external input provenance across new sessions and derived SOPs, without depending on the creator task lifetime. Source withdrawal also governs first reads, cached calls, child admission and private or explicitly published derivatives; administrators use existing permission/MFA/reason/audit controls. Closing the app fences requests still waiting for their local journal write.

Historical stage-76 inventory: 65 actual test files / 17 complete batches / 848 passing tests; all 830 stage-75 cases remain covered. SQL001–093 remain unchanged; SQL094 adds native workflow provenance and immutable versions. The actual 428-route inventory retains all prior 415 routes. Original 102 REQ/102 TC, NFR and G01–G10 remain open at 81 partial / 21 unproven / 0 fully accepted. Earlier evidence and media retain their original source scope.
