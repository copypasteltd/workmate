A cloud Agent product for Hong Kong enterprises. This repository owns **Web** and publishes to `web`.

<!-- client01-direction -->
## Current client direction and qualified scope

CLIENT01 (2026-10-22) requires **Desktop to run Codex on the customer's computer**, with a real user-opt-in **full local access** mode and Codex Desktop as the operation benchmark. The **Extension uses a ChatGPT-style conversation and attachment layout in Chrome's native right Side Panel**, reads user-selected files and uploads them for cloud Codex execution. All product AI calls still use the company gateway.

**Current implementation:** Desktop runs Codex on the customer device with explicit full access, local files/terminal, persistent threads and company tools/billing. Native questions now support explicit options/free text, stop and revocation while waiting. Current source passes 47 client tests, 17 real-native tests and 12 actual packaged-Electron journey checks. Unchanged backend source retains its stage 73 complete 818-test regression scope. Sixteen admitted native role protocols are not full professional qualification; video/workflow tools, complete browser/application automation, all eighteen roles/twenty-nine Skills and production acceptance remain open. Provider responses and native-dialog decisions are explicit fixtures. Extension retains native right Side Panel cloud conversations and selected-file uploads. See [design](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/technical/74-desktop-native-user-input.md) and [source/media evidence](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/quality/desktop-native-input-checkpoint.json).

Desktop runs the native Agent locally; the Web and Extension run cloud Codex. The linked stage 73 proof states the tested scope.

Native supervisor scope, actual permission checks and remaining integration: [implementation details](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/technical/70-desktop-native-codex-supervisor.md).

## Architecture and constraints

Codex is the only Agent kernel. All AI calls use the company's internal OpenAI-compatible server. Web, Desktop, extension and Admin share server identity, permissions, sources and billing controls. UI follows CopyPaste brand assets, colors, typography and bilingual patterns.

## Product and usage flow

1. Visit the workspace and sign in with an email code. First verification can create a customer account. Production uses SMTP; local demonstrations use the development mailbox.
2. Create/select a workspace and project. The server checks membership, project rights, funding subject and private conversation ownership.
3. Select the default assistant, an installed preset among eighteen roles, or a personal specialist. Tasks freeze role, skills, brand, model and price versions.
4. Select files, brand materials and marketing connections. Access/plan/budget checks precede an atomic budget hold and execution.
5. Inspect state, messages, outputs, actual sources and usage. Explicitly select authorized versions for missing inputs and continue the original task. Refreshes retain unsubmitted choices.
6. Download or explicitly publish an independent deliverable copy. Revocation, invalid sources and denied current reads fence unavailable content. Notifications, plans, conversations and memory retain their own scopes.

## Pages and business modules

Workspace, specialist catalog, personal specialists, project methods/Skills, notifications, private conversations, memory, projects, files/devices, members, usage/plans and account settings share workspace/project context. Creative flows cover design, brand, advertising, ecommerce, social, typography, presentations, information design and template video. Marketing includes file analytics, ad connections and scoped website audit/change-draft/recheck flows.

`src/main.tsx` contains entry/routing. Domain components implement conversations, tasks, inputs, creative work, connections and analytics. `src/api.ts` and session code centralize Backend access. React/TypeScript/Vite, with repository-provided fonts and brand assets.

## Run

```powershell
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4317` after starting backend at `http://localhost:4310`. See `.env.example` and `vite.config.ts`. The frontend contains company service origins and no model API secrets. Production static hosting requires the documented HTTPS, cookie/Origin/CSP and Backend configuration.

## Interaction rules

Refreshes of the same task retain selected inputs; workspace/project/task changes and failed reads clear prior content. State, recorded usage and settled charges are separate. Initial pre-model waits and waits after a measured paid turn use different copy. Published copies and downloads remain governed by current sources, retention and authorization.

## Checkout and prerequisites

Clone this branch into a fresh working directory; update an existing repository without reinitializing it.

```powershell
git clone --single-branch --branch web git@github.com:copypasteltd/workmate.git copypaste-web
cd copypaste-web
```

Use Node.js ≥22.14, npm and Git with pinned lockfiles. The qualified local environment is Windows x64. Backend/full delivery also needs native PostgreSQL launcher resources, pinned Codex `0.163.0-alpha.10.2` and FFmpeg/FFprobe. No local Docker, WSL or virtualization. Run components in separate directories; see [workspace](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/governance/04-git-branches-and-publication.md).

## Checks and evidence scope

```powershell
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Historical-source **802/802** full Platform tests and **52/52** focused task tests pass, with **13 checks** across six repositories and **32** actual packaged Desktop/native Side Panel checks. All prior 782 named regression cases remain. Task checks exercise actual PostgreSQL, identity, ledger and Worker; separate real Codex child processes use a synthetic internal gateway. UI turns/business data are synthetic as authorized. The original 102 requirements remain: 81 partially verified, 21 without proven completion and zero fully accepted.

Canonical TaskDTO/task creation, arbitrary in-flight pause, unknown-effect recovery, independent complete role workflows, GEO, live suppliers and production/signing/store qualification remain tracked.

This revision adds canonical task APIs and atomic original-task inputs. Current UIs continue to use their existing project/conversation interfaces over the same execution domain. The refreshed actual recordings verify compatibility; they do not claim migration of every UI to canonical task APIs. See [the implementation and limits](https://github.com/copypasteltd/workmate/blob/docs/docs/technical/68-canonical-task-contracts-and-input-transactions.md) for exact money, idempotency, source revocation and unsupported business parameters.

## Actual screens and interactions

Actual recordings preserve capture timing. AI turns/business data are explicitly synthetic. Admin form demonstrations do not claim a financial commit.
